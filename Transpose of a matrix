Understanding Maths concepts is also useful to develop A.I based programs so lets start with basic level mathematical question
To find transpose of a given rxc matrix

r = int(input())
c=int(input())
lis=[]
for i in range(r):
    l=list(map(int,input().strip().split()[:c]))
    lis.append(l)

print("Transpose of the given matrix is:")
for j in range(c):
    for k in range(r):
        print(lis[k][j],end=" ")
    print()
